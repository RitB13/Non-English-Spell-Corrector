# Non-English Spell Corrector

**Auto Spell Correction for Non-English Words in English Script**

---

## Overview

This project implements a highly accurate and efficient spell correction system for non-English words written in the English alphabet (e.g., Hindi, Marathi). It intelligently handles typographical errors, phonetic variations, vowel stretching/reduction, and case insensitivity by combining **phonetic similarity**, **string similarity**, and **frequency-based scoring**.

The system can process large text files and suggest top candidate corrections using advanced algorithms like **SymSpell** and **BK-Tree**.
